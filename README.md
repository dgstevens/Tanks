Tanks
=====

A tanks game written in JavaScript using HTML5 canvases. Started with the end goal of being a Google+ Hangouts App. Download everything and open test.html in a web browser to play the current version. A slightly less up-to-date version can be found at www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/dgsteven/Tanks/tanks.html


This project is still very buggy, with testing/obsolete code in many places. Sorry.

background.js -- Handles the terrain generation and destruction
tank.js -- The tank itself. Most of the code deals with calculating what angle the tank should be displayed at
circShot.js -- Implements a simple bullet that files in a parabolic arc and explodes with a circular explosion.
test.html -- The page where the game runs.
